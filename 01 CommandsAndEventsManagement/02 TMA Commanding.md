Introduction
============

This document contains the different components related to the commands and
events from the TMA that are:

-   TCP Client: this component is the one that connects to the TMA over TCP to
    send and receive the TCP messages. The message to send is specified to the
    task by a public method of the TCP client object, and the received messages
    are published in a user event created when the object is initialized.

-   TMA Commanding: this component is the one sending commands to the TMA and
    monitoring the events received from it. This is done using the TCP Client
    component.

-   Alarm Management: this component gets the alarm and warning events from the
    TCP client, logging the received alarms and warnings to have a record of the
    different events occurred while operating the system.

TMA Commanding
==============

This component is the one sending commands to the TMA and monitoring the events
received from it. This is done using the TCP Client component and some other
tasks that will be explained in this section. This component has two main
different parts:

-   Command sending: this means generating the TCP message to send to the TMA
    using the TCP Client. This is done using the CppAppCommand.lvclass. This
    class is the one that generates the TCP message for each specific command
    and sends them to the TMA using the TCP Client.

-   Event reception: this means getting the messages from the TMA over the TCP
    Client and generating the corresponding events inside the HMI application.
    This is done using the GetEVENTFromTMA.lvclass. This class is responsible of
    parsing the events from the TMA received by the TCP Client and generate the
    corresponding events inside the HMI application.

In addition to these two classes there are two other classes inside the TMA
Commanding component. These are:

-   TMAOMTMonitoring.lvclass: this class is used to monitor the status of the
    TMA received in the “*StateInfo*” events.

-   CommanderCheck.lvclass: this class is used to monitor the actual commander
    and generate the corresponding events to change the user interface and block
    the command sending when the actual HMI is not the commander.

Each of the classes mentioned in above are explained in the upcoming sections.

CppAppCommand.lvclass
---------------------

This class is the one that generates the TCP message for each specific command
and sends them to the TMA using the TCP Client. To do so, each subsystem has a
specific class that inherits from the CppAppCommand class and has the specific
commands available for that subsystem. The methods in the parent class, the
CppAppCommand class, are dynamic dispatch and overridden by the child classes.

### Methods

Here each of the available methods are listed.

#### CppAppCommand_Init

Initialize the command father object, this means initialize the ID repo (for
having an incremental ID different every time), the source repo and the repo for
the TCP Client (the object from the Sender.lvclass that corresponds to the TCP
Client).

Having a repo for each of this values allows the system to work without needing
to pass the parent object to all the windows, it is initialized at the
application launch and the values are stored in the repos and are available just
with an empty object of the parent class.

GetEventfromTMA.lvclass
-----------------------

This class is responsible of parsing the events from the TMA received by the TCP
Client and generate the corresponding events inside the HMI application.

### Task process

This task was created using the NI GOOP Developing Suite, this task is object
oriented and the communication between methods is done using queues and user
events. The task main is contained in the process.vi, here there is one loop.
The loop is used for CMD reception, see Figure \ref{figurethirty-three69459e04fb4b90c71b521567c9afc8ef}. This process has only one
instance that manages all the received events from the TMA.

![GetEventFromTMA task\label{figurethirty-three69459e04fb4b90c71b521567c9afc8ef}](../Resources/figures/69459e04fb4b90c71b521567c9afc8ef.png)

### Task methods

Here the available methods for this task are explained.

#### GetEVENTFromTMA_Init.vi

Initialize the process to hear from TMA OMT.

The initialized process will get ACK, DONE, ERROR and WARNINGS that come from
the TMA (operation_manager). It will also get the state change and error from
the TMA OMT (operation_manager) itself.

![Task method: GetEventFromTMA_Init\label{figurethirty-four74a6d5ce8acd1e1bde61e9197fd16bad}](../Resources/figures/74a6d5ce8acd1e1bde61e9197fd16bad.png)

#### CleanUp

Stop task process and destroy user events.

![Task method: CleanUp\label{figurethirty-five625255128b48dfab8cc2ef1aa628e8ab}](../Resources/figures/625255128b48dfab8cc2ef1aa628e8ab.png)

#### ControlProcessWindow

This VI is used to show or hide the process front panel. Depending on the
ShowProcessWindow control value.

![Task method: ControlProcessWindow\label{figurethirty-six5b09030f1c224f409c548c97e07cd083}](../Resources/figures/5b09030f1c224f409c548c97e07cd083.png)

#### GetEventRefs

This VI is used to return the references to the different events: ack, done,
error and warning.

![Task method: GetEventRefs\label{figurethirty-sevend440b222f78f8f6b8dc91f280e9453c3}](../Resources/figures/d440b222f78f8f6b8dc91f280e9453c3.png)

### CMD Reception loop

This loop receives the commands from the public methods and executes the
corresponding actions. This loop has a state for each method as well as some
other states used for loop managing, each state is explained in the next
sections.

#### Init

This state is just executed once and is the first executed one. Here the
initialization actions are executed. These are:

-   Initialization of local variable

-   Registration of events for the event structure

-   Updating the displayed name of the VI for debug purposes

![GetEVENTFromTMA.lvclass_Process.vi Init\label{figurethirty-eight7594b113e7a74001bbb6be57518ab3a3}](../Resources/figures/7594b113e7a74001bbb6be57518ab3a3.png)

#### Idle

This state is executed constantly after executing every new CMD, here the events
created at the methods are received and executed in the next iteration, in the
event called â€œEventsToProcessâ€ see Figure \ref{figureforty0ffa46f585c98b683a6134b3b50cf30d}.

![GetEVENTFromTMA.lvclass_Process.vi Idle\label{figurethirty-ninefd6414a2c920162a8a200737a0b5767b}](../Resources/figures/fd6414a2c920162a8a200737a0b5767b.png)

![GetEVENTFromTMA.lvclass_Process.vi EventsToProcess\label{figureforty0ffa46f585c98b683a6134b3b50cf30d}](../Resources/figures/0ffa46f585c98b683a6134b3b50cf30d.png)

In addition to this, the TCP messages received from the TCP Client as user
events are received and parsed, the event that receives the TCP messages is
called “DataFromTCP” see Figure \ref{figureforty-onef00e25525f869863dacc2c4672994d39}. The TCP messages are parsed and the
appropriate user events are generated, these events are:

-   Ack event: this event is used to transmit the received ack or no ack events.

-   Done event: this event is used to transmit the done events.

-   Error event: this event is used to transmit the received fault events.

-   Warning event: this event is used to transmit the received warning events.

-   Version event: this event is used to transmit the version from the TMA.

With some messages no user events are generated. These cases are:

-   StateInfo: when this message is received the state of the TMA is updated
    using the methods from the TMAOMTMonitoring.lvclass. For “State” submessages
    from the StateInfo messages the state of the TMA statemachine must be
    updated, to do so the PublishTMAOMTState method from the
    CommanderCheck.lvclass is used.

-   InPosition: not used in the HMI application.

![GetEVENTFromTMA.lvclass_Process.vi DataFromTCP\label{figureforty-onef00e25525f869863dacc2c4672994d39}](../Resources/figures/f00e25525f869863dacc2c4672994d39.png)

#### Timeout

This state is executed when there is something that must be executed in the
specified timeout of the Idle state event structure, see Figure \ref{figureforty-twoffea54a30df54a93c2d371689872356d}.

![Timeout state from Idle state\label{figureforty-twoffea54a30df54a93c2d371689872356d}](../Resources/figures/ffea54a30df54a93c2d371689872356d.png)

#### ShowWindow

This state is used to show the front panel of the process.

![CMD Receiver states: ShowWindow\label{figureforty-foure69d2d974ee18af4bb649e21db92269b}](../Resources/figures/e69d2d974ee18af4bb649e21db92269b.png)

#### HideWindow

This state is used to hide the front panel of the process.

![CMD Receiver states: HideWindow\label{figureforty-five4804276518cb9f6e2c8f0ccbdc7abf31}](../Resources/figures/4804276518cb9f6e2c8f0ccbdc7abf31.png)

#### Shutdown

This state is reached when the shutdown CMD is received. This loop is used to
stop the CMD receiver loop.

![GetEVENTFromTMA.lvclass_Process.vi shutdown\label{figureforty-sixb2b82c4abc519e2523f469bacf952aa8}](../Resources/figures/b2b82c4abc519e2523f469bacf952aa8.png)

#### Error

This state is reached when an error occurs at the task, here the error is
published and cleared for the next iteration.

![GetEVENTFromTMA.lvclass_Process.vi Error\label{figureforty-seven16549f5ba20f1abe2e0b7bb142b70442}](../Resources/figures/16549f5ba20f1abe2e0b7bb142b70442.png)

TMAOMTMonitoring task
---------------------

To be updated

This task is responsible of monitoring the TMA OMT status.

Here the CSC connection status, CSC commands, CSC Events and TMA OMT actual
state are received and saved.

### Task process

This task was created using the NI GOOP Developing Suite, this task is object
oriented and the communication between methods is done using queues and user
events. The task main is contained in the process.vi, here there is a single
loop. This loop contains both the CMD reception and the CMD actions execution.
This process has only one instance that manages all the received data.

CommanderCheck task
-------------------

To be updated

This task will be waiting for commands form outside and, in the timeout, will
check the actual commander var. If the commander has changed an event will be
placed in Events from process with new data.

### Task process

This task was created using the NI GOOP Developing Suite, this task is object
oriented and the communication between methods is done using queues and user
events. The task main is contained in the process.vi, here there is a single
loop. This loop contains both the CMD reception and the CMD actions execution.
This process has only one instance that manages all the received data.

![CommanderCheck task\label{figureseventy-four7363c779e5996d2aacc057f4407333e2}](../Resources/figures/7363c779e5996d2aacc057f4407333e2.png)

### Task methods

Here the available methods for this task are explained.

#### CommanderCheck_Init

This VI is used to launch the process, to do so some inputs are required:

-   Commander Variable URL: a string with the URL of the CommanderVariable that
    the process will use to know if the commander has changed and how is the new
    commander.

-   Status Variable URL: a string with the URL of the Status Variable that the
    process will use publish the last TMA OMT status.
