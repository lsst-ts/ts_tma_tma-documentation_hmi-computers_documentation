# Introduction

This document contains the different components related to the commands and
events from the TMA that are:

-   TCP Client: this component is the one that connects to the TMA over TCP to
    send and receive the TCP messages. The message to send is specified to the
    task by a public method of the TCP client object, and the received messages
    are published in a user event created when the object is initialized.

-   TMA Commanding: this component is the one sending commands to the TMA and
    monitoring the events received from it. This is done using the TCP Client
    component.

-   Alarm Management: this component gets the alarm and warning events from the
    TCP client, logging the received alarms and warnings to have a record of the
    different events occurred while operating the system.
